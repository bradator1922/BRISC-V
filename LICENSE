This repository contains original hardware architecture, RTL design, 
microarchitectural structures, and associated Verilog/SystemVerilog code 
developed as part of the author's academic research.

Permission is granted to any individual to view, study, and modify the 
source code for personal learning, academic understanding, or experimentation.

However, the following restrictions apply:

1. PROHIBITED USES
   ---------------------------------
   (a) The original architecture, microarchitecture, RTL structure, 
       datapath, pipeline stages, control logic, or any substantially 
       similar design may NOT be:
       - used or submitted in any academic assignment,
       - incorporated into any hardware or software implementation,
       - redistributed in whole or in part,
       - used as the basis for coursework, research, or commercial work,
       unless explicit written permission is obtained from the author.

   (b) Derivative works that retain the same architectural structure, design 
       philosophy, module organization, or behavior as the original design 
       are strictly prohibited from being used or submitted as original work.

2. ALLOWED USES
   ---------------------------------
   (a) You may modify the code ONLY if the resulting design is substantially 
       different from the original architecture.

   (b) You may use the code for reference or learning to:
       - understand digital design concepts,
       - develop your own unique architecture or RTL implementation.

3. DEFINITION OF “SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT”
   ---------------------------------
   A derivative work is considered substantially different only if it does 
   NOT replicate or closely mimic:
   - the datapath layout,
   - the control architecture,
   - pipeline segmentation or hazard mechanisms,
   - state machines or module-level behavior,
   - interconnect structure,
   - naming conventions that imply architectural identity.

4. NO REDISTRIBUTION
   ---------------------------------
   Redistribution of this source code, in original or modified form, is not 
   permitted without written permission from the author.

5. ACADEMIC INTEGRITY NOTICE
   ---------------------------------
   Use of this code, or any close derivative, as part of an academic 
   submission without permission constitutes academic misconduct and 
   plagiarism under standard university policies.

6. NO WARRANTY
   ---------------------------------
   This code is provided “as-is” for educational purposes. The author 
   offers no warranty regarding correctness, performance, or suitability 
   for any application.
